# Sionna RT: The Ray Tracing Package of Sionna&trade;

[Sionna RT](https://nvlabs.github.io/sionna-rt) is the stand-alone ray tracing package of the [Sionna&trade; Library for Research
on Communication Systems](https://github.com/NVlabs/sionna).
It is built on top of [Mitsuba 3](https://github.com/mitsuba-renderer/mitsuba3) and is interoperable with
[TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/), and [JAX](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).

The official documentation can be found on the [Sionna
website](https://nvlabs.github.io/sionna/).


## Installation

The recommended way to install Sionna RT is via pip:

```
pip install sionna-rt
```

Sionna RT has the same requirements as Mitsuba 3 and we refer to its
[installation guide](https://mitsuba.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for further information.

To run Sionna RT on CPU, [LLVM](https://llvm.org) is required by Dr.Jit.
